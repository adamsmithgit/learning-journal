### Learning Markdown ###

Markdown is a way to format plain text.

Markdown uses symbols to denote how text should be displayed. For example ** denotes **bold** text.

Markdown is helpful to coders as it provides a simple way to write prose using the same text editor as they use for coding.

Markdown supports a limited set of text formating options such as headings, lists, links, quotes, and code blocks. Using markdown it is quick to write and format text. It is considered more readable than markup languages that require opening and closing tags for all elements. 

While the format options supported by markdown are limited, it does support HTML so if a more complex format, such as a table is required, the writer can write HTML in the markdown file like this:

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Column 1</td>
    <td>Column 1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
Which will be rendered by Markdown like this:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Column 1</td>
    <td>Column 1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
