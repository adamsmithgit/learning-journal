### Learning Markdown

Markdown is a way to format plain text.

Markdown uses symbols to denote how text should be displayed. For example ** denotes **bold** text.

Markdown is helpful to coders as it provides a simple way to write prose using the same text editor as they use for coding.

Markdown supports a limited set of text formating options such as headings, lists, links, quotes, and code blocks. Using markdown it is quick to write and format text. It is considered more readable than markup languages that require opening and closing tags for all elements.

Github has extended the core Markdown to support additional symbols. For example Github Flavored Markdown (GFM) supports a table layout using colons. 
```
| Item          | Cost          | Quantity  | Total    |
|:--------------|--------------:| ---------:|---------:|
| Cat           |          $30  |         4 |     $120 |
| Dog           |          $40  |         2 |      $80 |
| Cow           |          $90  |         1 |      $90 |
```

Which will render like this:
| Item          | Cost          | Quantity  | Total    |
|:--------------|--------------:| ---------:|---------:|
| Cat           |          $30  |         4 |     $120 |
| Dog           |          $40  |         2 |      $80 |
| Cow           |          $90  |         1 |      $90 |


Markdown also supports HTML so the writer can write HTML in the markdown file like this:
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Column 1</td>
    <td>Column 1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
Which will be rendered by Markdown like this-
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Column 1</td>
    <td>Column 1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
