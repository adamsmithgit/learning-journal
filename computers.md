## How Computers Work

### What Makes a Computer a Computer?
Computers manipulate information.

Computers Input, Store, Process, & Output

Input: human interface analog signals, digital inputs

Storage: store in memory -> sent to processor -> back to memory

Output: display, directly control device, send to another computer

### Binary & Data
Computers work in binary 1 & 0

Signal can be electrica signal on or off, 1 or 0, true or false, this is a bit

Using binary system, any number can be represented with base 2 places

Text, images, and sound can be represented with numbers

A pixel on a screen, a wave form, etc. can be represented by a number

### Circuits and Logic
To process input into output, computers modify & combine the information

This is done in components which together form circuits

Simple circuits include Not, And, Or, Nor

In combination more complex circuits are made

Computer circuits have become smaller and faster, can perform billions of calculations per second

### CPU, Memory, Input & Output
Input devices take physical often analog signals and convert them into digital infomation

E.g., keyboard, sensors, microphone

Memory stores information

E.g., keyboard converts letter to a binary number which is stored in memory

CPU processes information

E.g., follows instructions to create binary signals that map a physical representation of a letter

Cutput devices convert information to a physical form

E.g., using the 'map' binary numbers a screen turns pixels on or off to represent the letter

There are lots of types of inputs and outputs that let computers interact with the world

Computers have lots of memory and often multiple processors to help process the information quickly

### Hardware and Software
Hardware includes the circuits, wires, speakers, screen

Software is the programs that run on the computer

The CPU controls the other parts of the computer

It has math and logic circuits, and circuits to send and receive information

CPUs recieve commands (in binary) that tell it which circuits to use

Programming languages allow us to write commands in something closer to English

These commands are converted into binary commands that are sent to the processor

The Operating System manages how software uses the hardware of the computer

The OS controls the other software on the computer, e.g. loading other programs, accessing an output device

The OS shares the CPU with various programs that are running

Coding - define the problem you want to solve, write the software that turns the idea into reality, build things that matter
