## Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

JavaScript is used to add interactivity to a web page. We can use it to respond to events, such as when a user clicks on a button.

JavaScript is written in plain text. The script can be inserted into an HTML file (using the `<Script>` element), or preferrably it can be in a separate file and linked to the HTML file by reference (usign the `link` element and `href` attribute).

It is good practice to separate concerns. The content in the HTML layer, the style (presentation) in the CSS layer, and front-end interactivity in the JavaScript layer.
