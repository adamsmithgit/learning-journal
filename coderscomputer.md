### Text Editors

Web developers use text editors to write and manage text, including code. While operating systems typically provide basic text editors, third party options that provide the features above can make coding more efficient. Popular third party editors include Sublime, Notepad++, VS Code, Atom, Vim, and UltraEdit. Features that can make coding efficient and comfortable include:

* Syntax highlighting, which displays text in different colors according to the category of terms;
* Code completion - which based on what you start typing, predict and offer suggestions that can be selected;
* Customization of theme - which allow you to choose background and text colors that you find preferrable and that might reduce eye strain; and
* Extensions - which allow you to add additional features to your text editor.

Selecting a text editor is a choice based on personal preferences. Programmers often use a text editor within a n Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The IDE includes the text editor along with other tools that support managing files, compiling code, debugging, and deployment.
